Inverse Map (фоф-1) of a R^n->R^n-1 such that the L-B eq. are sattisfied means 
Existence Of Teichmuller Holomorphic Function(Feynman/Polyakov Path integral).

Such That
	F*F^-1= 1/2 Log Fx/Fx2
	-> Which Is Jacoby Change Of Coordinates and is how Bosonic string is derived.

For Hyperbolic Solutions
Polyakov Has To Have A T-sym Metric(linear sigma model Nambu-GoTo equivalence)

11-D Supra And D10 Super String -> M-Theory Compact
Also Is A Type Of Teichmuller Torus Embedding -> Strogatsky theorem on manifolds
	1/(1-Exp(-X)) = 1/2 Log Fx/Fx2.

This is A Quantim Model With Additive Model
	(R^11 X S^1D)
- Integral from <-inf to inf>

	The Thurston Boundary Of The Teichmüller Space Of A Closed Surface Of Genus G
	\{\Displaystyle G} G Is Homeomorphic To A Sphere Of Dimension 6 G − 7 {\Displaystyle 6g-7} {\Displaystyle 6g-7}.
	For G>=2 , 5
	Thurston Constructed A Compactification Of The
	Teichmüller Space T(S) Of A Surface S Such That
	The Action Induced On T(S) By Any Diffeomorphism F
	Of S Extends To A Homeomorphism Of The Thurston
	Compactification. The Dynamics Of This Homeomorphism
	Is The Simplest When F Is A Pseudo-Anosov Map: In This
	Case, There Are Two Fixed Points On The Thurston Boundary,
	One Attracting And One Repelling, And The Homeomorphism Behaves Similarly To A Hyperbolic Automorphism Of The Poincaré Half-Plane. 
	A "Generic" Diffeomorphism Of A Surface Of Genus At Least Two Is Isotopic To A Pseudo-Anosov Diffeomorphism.

-> (1-X^2) Linear Limit. -> For Weak Energy as is done in linearised gravity(Newthonian limit)
->Holomorphic Due To Teichmuller Universal covering, embedded torus with Penrose like dynamics)
	Admits One Einstein-Kahler Solution/ metric, a non closed(gap-existance) ADS/CFT from bellow, and a hyperbolic DS for future cones
		After that evolving the equations in Matrix theory should lead cyclic universe
