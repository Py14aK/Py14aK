	THE MEANING OF REALITYIVTY.
	 We make arguments that Gravity is 
	already quantised, for proof we use the cosmic microwave background, we take 
	the princeple of equivalence as the , ost important aspect of GR
. We use the observed fact that GRAVITY CAN only be weak. We notice that EM 
	even though affected by the newly found gravitaonal BG, seems to be 
	unaffected. For we proof we give the photoelectrTHE MEANING OF REALITYIVTYic effect.  If GR WAS 
	INDEPENDAT, WE WOULD OBSERVE THE ELONGATION OF LIGHT WAVES AND THE 
	SPONTANASIOUS EMISSION THAT FOLLOW. WE DO OBSERVE THAT ELECTRONS ARE AFFECTED 
	BY GR AFFECTED AT THE SAME TIME BY NOTCING A(MUON LIFETIME, TAO IN ATMP). 
THE BACKSCATTERING OF OUR ATM SIGNALKING NON LINEAR GAMMA. The energy of the 
	recent Gamma sc. event is close to that of the higgs energy, it came 30 years 
	after the current record holder from the same angle of space. BUT WHEN ONE 
	TRIES TO MATH THE TIVE OF THE EVENT WITH THE SOURCE THE DISTANCE OF SPACETIME 
	TAKES A THOMAE LIKE DISTRIBUTION. this is impossible when comparing an 
	expanding universe that is the requirent that Spacetime is a pseudo rieman 
	manifold LOCALLY + pr of eq lead to the possibility that Euclid's 5th postulate is wrong. That meeans that lines are perpendicular only for a short time. 
	 Notice as well that Ligo cathegorised the emission as that of a medium BH MERGER. THE LACK OF NON SPINNIG BH OR FOR A MATTER OF FACT THE IMPOSSIBILITYH OF ONE. BY MACH'S 
	PRINCIPLE ANGULUR MOMENTUM IS CONSEVERVED. THE INVOLUTION AND STELLAR COLLAPSE 
	AND THE VILANT EVENTS THAT FOLLOW FOR A SUPERNOVA PRODUCTYION, B MAGNETARS, 
	CNEUTRANT STARS AND, FAILED BROWN DWARVES.SINCE DIRECT BH COLLAP[SE IS OF THE 
	ORDER 2.5MO. THE LIMIT DO DIRECT BH COLLAPSE WOULD GIVE A SIZEABLE DISTR OF 
	SWARTZCHILD CANDIDATE BHS. THAT ARE EMITTING JETS AT A ANGLE SMALLER THAN THAT 
	OF XRAY EMISSION. [add figure one]

\end{abstract}IN FACT ACRREATION DISKS AROUND BINARRY HOLLES WOULD SHOW 
	THIS. The fock soluttion for 3 body scattering is not observed. it also allows 
	for another question. can a bh appear collapsed to a obsever that is not 
	spinning since the swz solution allows for such a frame. Event further the 
	recent nanograv experiment, showed evidence for cosmic strings. We argue that 
	this distr is exac
\section{Introduction}exactly tailed to that of a null vector in Swz, and the 
	date can be explained by Torsion in Spacetime itself. Noether's theorem requires lorentz invariance but this can be done in two ways. either the spin
	 tensor is zero,that is the trace is zero or that the Swarzchild derivative is not zero.

	 	 We construct an Octanion Algebra with Galois Completion in 5 Diomensions , a Division algebra Z/nZ with a power completion thanks to hensel lifting .

a = 1 + 7 + 2*7^2 + O(R, 7^3)
b = 2 + 5*7 + 3*7^2 + O(R, 7^3)
c = 3*7 + 2*7^2 + O(R, 7^5)

c = exp(c)
d = log(a)
c = exp(R(0))
d = log(R(1))

The trees visible from the origin are those at lattice points 
(x, y, 0), where x and y are coprime, i.e., where the fraction x/y is in reduced form. The name Euclid's orchard is derived from the Euclidean algorithm.

If the orchard is projected relative to the origin onto the plane
 x + y = 1 (or, equivalently, drawn in perspective from a viewpoint at the origin) the tops of the trees form a graph of Thomae's function. The point (x, y, 1) projects to
