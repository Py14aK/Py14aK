let $\alpha:[0,1] \rightarrow X$ be a path from $x$ to $y$ in $X$. We define the length of the arc to be $d_{\alpha}(x, y)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d\left(\alpha\left(\frac{i}{n}\right), \alpha\left(\frac{i+1}{n}\right)\right)$

Definition $3.1$

An arc $\alpha$ in a geodesic metric space $X$ is called a $(\lambda, \epsilon)$-quasigeodesic if there are positive constants $\lambda>1, \epsilon \geq 0$ such that for all points $x, y$ on $\alpha$,

$$
d_{\alpha}(x, y) \leq \lambda d(x, y)+\epsilon
$$

We must first prove the following technical result, which is essential to all that follows.

Proposition 3.2.
( $(\mathrm{G}, 8.1 . \mathrm{D}],[\mathrm{GH}, 8.21])$
Let $g$ be an element of infinite order in a hyperbolic group $G$, and let $\Gamma$
 be the Cayley graph with respect to some finite generating set. Let $\alpha$ be a path from the vertex corresponding to the identity element to the vertex corresponding to $g$. Then the bi-infinite path
 
 
 What does all this have to do with normed division algebras? To answer this, let $\mathbb{K}$ be a normed division algebra of dimension $n$. Then the Jordan algebra $h_{2}(\mathbb{K})$ is secretly a spin factor! There is an isomorphism 
 
$$
\phi: \mathfrak{h}_{2}(\mathbb{K}) \rightarrow J(\mathbb{K} \oplus \mathbb{R}) \cong \mathbb{K} \oplus \mathbb{R} \oplus \mathbb{R}
$$

given by

% $$
% \phi\left(\begin{array}{cc}
% \alpha+\beta & x \\
% x^{*} & \alpha-\beta
% \end{array}\right)=(x, \beta, \alpha), \quad x \in \mathbb{K}, \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}
% $$

% Furthermore, the determinant of matrices in $\mathfrak{h}_{2}(\mathbb{K})$ is well-defined even when $\mathbb{K}$ is noncommutative or nonassociative:

% $$
% \operatorname{det}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
% \alpha+\beta & x \\
% x^{*} & \alpha-\beta
% \end{array}\right)=\alpha^{2}-\beta^{2}-\|x\|^{2}, -> can use Hyp. so that it's a smaller Basiis. $$


and clearly we have

$$
\operatorname{det}(a)=-\phi(a) \cdot \phi(a)
$$

for all $a \in \mathfrak{h}_{2}(\mathbb{K})$

The hyperboloid model can be represented as the equation $t^{2}=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+1, t>1$. It can used to construct a Poincaré disk model as projection viewed from $\left(t=-1, x_{1}=0, x_{2}=0\right)$, projecting the upper half hyperboloid onto unit disk at $\mathrm{t}=0$. The red geodesic in the Poincaré disk model projects to the brown geodesic on the green hyperboloid.

where $\delta_{i j}$ is the Kronecker delta (equal to 1 if and only if $i=j$ ), and $\varepsilon_{i j k}$ is a completely antisymmetric tensor with value 1 when $i j k=123,145,176,246,257,347,365.$

The complex numbers can be written as ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of real numbers $a$ and $b$, with the addition operator being component-wise and with multiplication defined by
$$
(a, b)(c, d)=(a c-b d, a d+b c) .
$$
A complex number whose second component is zero is associated with a real number: the complex number $(a, 0)$ is associated with the real number $a$.
The complex conjugate $(a, b)^{*}$ of $(a, b)$ is given by
$$
(a, b)^{*}=\left(a^{*},-b\right)=(a,-b)
$$
since $a$ is a real number and is its own conjugate.
The conjugate has the property that
$$
(a, b)^{*}(a, b)=(a a+b b, a b-b a)=\left(a^{2}+b^{2}, 0\right),
$$
which is a non-negative real number. In this way, conjugation defines a norm, making the complex numbers a normed vector space over the real numbers: the norm of a complex number $z$ is
$$
|z|=\left(z^{*} z\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \text {. }
$$
Furthermore, for any non-zero complex number $z$, conjugation gives a multiplicative inverse,
$$
z^{-1}=\frac{z^{*}}{1} \text {. }
$$

Suppose $f: D \rightarrow D^{\prime}$ where $D$ and $D^{\prime}$ are two domains in $\mathbf{C}$. There are a variety of equivalent definitions, depending on the required smoothness of $f$. If $f$ is assumed to have continuous partial derivatives, then $f$ is quasiconformal provided it satisfies the Beltrami equation
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}}=\mu(z) \frac{\partial f}{\partial z},
$$
for some complex valued Lebesgue measurable $\mu$ satisfying sup $|\mu|<1$ (Bers 1977). This equation admits a geometrical interpretation. Equip $D$ with the metric tensor
$$
d s^{2}=\Omega(z)^{2}|d z+\mu(z) d \bar{z}|^{2},
$$
where $\Omega(z)>0$. Then $f$ satisfies $(1)$ precisely when it is a conformal transformation from $D$ equipped with this metric to the domain $D^{\prime}$ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric. The function $f$ is then called $\boldsymbol{\mu}$-conformal. More generally, the continuous differentiability of $f$ can be replaced by the weaker condition that $f$ be in the Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(D)$ of functions whose first-order distributional derivatives are in $L^{2}(D)$. In this case, $f$ is required to be a weak solution of (1). When $\mu$ is zero almost everywhere, any homeomorphism in $W^{1,2}(D)$ that is a weak solution of (1) is conformal.
Without appeal to an auxiliary metric, consider the effect of the pullback under $lpf$ of the usual Euclidean metric. The resulting metric is then given by
$$
\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right|^{2}|d z+\mu(z) d \bar{z}|^{2}
$$

Subgroups
Given a group $\mathcal{R}$, if $S \subseteq \mathcal{R}$ is any subset of the group, then the subroup $H$ generated by $S$ is the smallest subroup of $\mathcal{R}$ that contains all the elements of $S$. For instance, $\{F\}$ generates a group that is a subgroup of $\mathcal{R}$ consisting of all possible different cube permutations you can get to by rotating the front face, $\left\{F, F^{2}, F^{3} F^{4}\right\}$. The group generated by $\{F, B, U, L, R, D\}$ is the whole group $\mathcal{R}$. Below are some examples of some generators of subroups of $\mathcal{R}:$
- Any single face rotation, e.g., $\{F\}$
- Any two opposite face rotations, e.g., $\{L R\}$
