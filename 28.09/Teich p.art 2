A quasi-convex subspace of an hyperbolic space is hyperbolic.

A quasi-isometry between two hyperbolic spaces X , Y {\displaystyle X,Y} X,Y induces a homeomorphism between the boundaries.

let $\alpha:[0,1] \rightarrow X$ be a path from $x$ to $y$ in $X$. We define the length of the arc to be $d_{\alpha}(x, y)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d\left(\alpha\left(\frac{i}{n}\right), \alpha\left(\frac{i+1}{n}\right)\right)$
Definition $3.1$
An arc $\alpha$ in a geodesic metric space $X$ is called a $(\lambda, \epsilon)$-quasigeodesic if there are positive constants $\lambda>1, \epsilon \geq 0$ such that f them concerns the complex structure: the Teichmuller space T ( g) is the set of …or all points $x, y$ on $\alpha$,
$$
d_{\alpha}(x, y) \leq \lambda d(x, y)+\epsilon
$$
We must first prove the following technical result, which is essential to all that follows.
Proposition 3.2. ( $(\mathrm{G}, 8.1 . \mathrm{D}],[\mathrm{GH}, 8.21])$
Let $g$ be an element of infinite order in a hyperbolic group $G$, and let $\Gamma$
 be the Cayley graph with respect to some finite generating set. Let $\alpha$ be a path from the vertex corresponding to the identity element to the vertex corresponding to $g$. Then the bi-infinite path

 What does all this have to do with normed division algebras? To answer this, let $\mathbb{K}$ be a normed division algebra of dimension $n$. Then the Jordan algebra $h_{2}(\mathbb{K})$ is secretly a spin factor! There is an isomorphism
$$
\phi: \mathfrak{h}_{2}(\mathbb{K}) \rightarrow J(\mathbb{K} \oplus \mathbb{R}) \cong \mathbb{K} \oplus \mathbb{R} \oplus \mathbb{R}
$$
given by
$$
\phi\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha+\beta & x \\
x^{*} & \alpha-\beta
\end{array}\right)=(x, \beta, \alpha), \quad x \in \mathbb{K}, \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}
$$
Furthermore, the determinant of matrices in $\mathfrak{h}_{2}(\mathbb{K})$ is well-defined even when $\mathbb{K}$ is noncommuta
tive or nonassociative:
$$
\operatorname{det}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha+\beta & x \\
x^{*} & \alpha-\beta
\end{array}\right)=\alpha^{2}-\beta^{2}-\|x\|^{2}, -> can use Hyp. so that it's a smaller Basiis. 
$$
and clearly we have
$$
\operatorname{det}(a)=-\phi(a) \cdot \phi(a)
$$
for all $a \in \mathfrak{h}_{2}(\mathbb{K})$

Именно тази форма на двумерната метрика се оказва най-удобна за гашите по-нататъшни разглеждания.
Като вземем предвид, че
$$
\eta=F(d \phi+A d t)
$$
следвайки дефиницията за 1-формата $\omega_{\eta}$, намираме
$$
\omega_{\eta}=-\frac{1}{2 \rho} F^{2} \star_{\perp} d A

The hyperboloid model can be represented as the equation $t^{2}=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+1, t>1$. It can used to construct a Poincaré disk model as projection viewed from $\left(t=-1, x_{1}=0, x_{2}=0\right)$, projecting the upper half hyperboloid onto unit disk at $\mathrm{t}=0$. The red geodesic in the Poincaré disk model projects to the brown geodesic on the green hyperboloid.
