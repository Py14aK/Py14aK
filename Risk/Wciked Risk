Py14ak's method across the stars

Complex Dynamix Non Linear Risk

Let’s look at a specific example. Assume a miner has purchased mining hardware 
with a combined hashing rate of 14, gigahashes per second (GH/s), 
or 14 TH/s. In 2017 this equipment costs approximately $ The hardware
consumes 1375 watts (1.3 kW) of electricity when running, 
3	3 kW-hours a day, at a cost of $1 to $2 per day at very
low electricity rates. At current bitcoin difficulty,
the miner will be able to solo mine a block approximately 
once every 4 years. How do we work out that probability? It is based on a network-wide hashing rate of 	3 EH/sec (in		17), and the miner’s rate of 14 TH/sec:
			    P = 4	1 	* 4	1( * 10 *S 3SO(3

The morphist requires 1 hour 37 minutes to so
